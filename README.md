# cssUndefinedClasses
Sigil plugin to delete all classes and ids from xhtml files in an epub that are not referenced in css nor in fragment identifiers.

There is a graphical interface that allows the user to choose which classes and IDs to delete, in which files to look for them and in which attributes to look for fragment identifiers (by default they are href, src and epub:textref).
